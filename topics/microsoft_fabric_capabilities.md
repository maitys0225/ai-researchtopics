# Epic: Evaluate and Integrate Microsoft Fabric for Unified Analytics Platform

## Description
This Epic focuses on evaluating Microsoft Fabric as a potential unified analytics solution for our organization. It aims to assess its capabilities in data integration, processing, security, and migration feasibility from existing Azure Databricks and ADF environments. The final goal is to determine its suitability for production use and plan phased integration where applicable.

## Goals
- Evaluate Microsoft Fabric's integration with Azure Databricks and ADF.
- Test security model implementation via Azure Entra ID.
- Assess connectivity to on-premise data sources via Data Gateway.
- Explore OneLake shortcuts with existing Azure Blob Storage.
- Determine compatibility of existing Spark processes and ADF pipelines.
- Define a roadmap for potential phased migration.

## Acceptance Criteria

### A. Microsoft Fabric & Azure Databricks Integration
- [ ] A working pipeline using the Azure Databricks activity in Fabric Data Factory is created.
- [ ] Successful read/write operations between Fabric and Databricks using ADLS passthrough or service principal.
- [ ] Documented limitations around Unity Catalog mirroring and security replication.
- [ ] Power BI connected to Databricks tables via Fabric.

### B. Microsoft Fabric & Azure Data Factory Compatibility
- [ ] Existing ADF pipelines mounted as "Azure Data Factory" items in Fabric.
- [ ] At least one ADF pipeline successfully invoked from a Fabric pipeline.
- [ ] Identify non-compatible features requiring reimplementation.

### C. Entra ID-based RBAC Implementation
- [ ] Role assignments (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer) configured and tested in Fabric.
- [ ] Item-level permissions applied and validated on selected Fabric artifacts.
- [ ] RLS and CLS demonstrated on a sample semantic model or SQL endpoint.
- [ ] Entra ID group-based permissions used and tested.

### D. On-Premise Data Gateway Integration
- [ ] On-premises Data Gateway installed and configured on a dedicated VM.
- [ ] Connection established to at least one legacy system (e.g., Oracle or IBM DB2).
- [ ] Data successfully pulled into Fabric via Data Factory pipeline.

### E. Azure Blob Storage Shortcut Testing in OneLake
- [ ] OneLake shortcut created pointing to an existing Blob Storage container.
- [ ] Access and query operations from Fabric confirmed via shortcut.
- [ ] Cost implications assessed and documented.

### F. Spark and ADF Pipeline Migration Feasibility
- [ ] Sample Databricks Spark process ported and tested in Fabric Spark runtime.
- [ ] Feature compatibility matrix created for Spark versions and libraries.
- [ ] Manual recreation of one ADF pipeline in Fabric Data Factory.
- [ ] Summary document on migration complexity and strategy.

### G. Final Evaluation & Recommendations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks executed comparing ADF/Dataflow Gen2 vs existing workloads.
- [ ] Security model audit log and policy validation completed.
- [ ] Summary report with pros, cons, and strategic recommendation authored.
