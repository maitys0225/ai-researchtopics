## **Understanding the Denodo Platform**

### **Core Concepts and Architecture**

The Denodo Platform embodies the principle of data virtualization, a methodology that provides a virtual or logical means of accessing, managing, and delivering data without necessitating its replication into a physical repository.1 This approach stands in contrast to conventional Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, which involve the physical movement and consolidation of data. Instead, Denodo offers a centralized data access layer that unifies distributed data in real time, operating without the constraints and overhead of data replication.1 At its core, the Denodo Platform leverages a universal semantic layer enriched with metadata. This layer imbues data with consistent business meaning, thereby simplifying the process for users to locate, comprehend, and trust the available information. Furthermore, it equips Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications with data that is readily usable for their operations.1 The platform's architecture is designed to align with modern data strategies, playing a pivotal role in initiatives such as cloud migration and the unification of data residing in data warehouses and data lakes.2

The increasing complexity and distribution of enterprise data have amplified the importance of logical data management. Traditional ETL processes often prove time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the need for extensive data movement and transformation. Data virtualization offers a more agile alternative by presenting a unified view of data without requiring physical consolidation. This agility is particularly crucial in today's dynamic business environment, where the demand for real-time insights is ever-growing. The universal semantic layer inherent in the Denodo Platform addresses the persistent challenge of data silos. Disparate data sources frequently employ varying terminologies and data structures, leading to inconsistencies that can hinder effective data utilization. By providing a common language and a unified understanding of data, the semantic layer enables business users to interpret and leverage information more effectively, irrespective of its original source.

## **Deep Dive into Denodo MPP**

### **Introduction to Massively Parallel Processing in Denodo**

Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) is a computational paradigm that involves the distribution of a workload across multiple processing nodes, enabling the parallel execution of tasks. This approach is particularly beneficial for processing large datasets, as it can significantly reduce the time required to complete complex analytical queries.10 Within the Denodo Platform, the Denodo Embedded MPP serves as a feature designed to enhance query performance in environments where data resides within object storage systems.12 This capability is built upon a customized version of Presto, which is an open-source parallel SQL query engine renowned for its efficiency in accessing data lake content.12 The primary objective of Denodo MPP is to provide an efficient and SQL-based means of accessing data lake content stored in formats such as Parquet, Delta Lake, and Iceberg.10 A key advantage of Denodo MPP is that it eliminates the necessity for organizations to deploy and manage additional external engines to interact with their data lakes.15 It is important to note that the Denodo Embedded MPP is a feature exclusive to the Enterprise Plus subscription bundle of the Denodo Platform.15

The integration of an MPP engine directly into the Denodo Platform reflects a strategic focus on enhancing performance for big data scenarios. This is achieved without introducing the added complexity of managing dependencies on external systems. By embedding Presto, a well-established and powerful MPP engine, Denodo offers a streamlined experience for users who need to work with substantial volumes of data, especially within data lake environments. This embedded approach simplifies both the deployment and management processes when compared to the alternative of integrating with separate, standalone MPP systems.

### **Architectural Components of Denodo MPP**

The architecture of Denodo MPP is composed of several key components that work together to enable parallel processing and efficient data access:

* **Presto Integration:** At the heart of Denodo MPP lies a customized version of the Presto distributed SQL query engine.12 Presto is designed for high-performance querying of large datasets distributed across one or more heterogeneous data sources.  
* **'embedded\_mpp' Data Source:** During the deployment of Denodo MPP, a special data source named 'embedded\_mpp' is automatically created within a new database called 'admin\_denodo\_mpp'.13 This data source serves as a crucial interface for interacting with the MPP engine. It allows users to graphically explore object storage systems such as Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, and HDFS.17 Furthermore, it enables the creation of base views directly over data stored in Parquet and Delta formats, abstracting the underlying storage complexities.17  
* **Embedded Hive Metastore and PostgreSQL:** Denodo MPP includes an embedded Hive Metastore, which acts as a central repository for managing metadata. This metastore is responsible for mapping the locations of data in object storage to the structure of Hive tables, providing a relational abstraction over the typically file-based data in data lakes.15 By default, the metadata for the Hive Metastore is stored in an embedded PostgreSQL database, simplifying the initial setup and management.15 However, for more demanding or enterprise-level deployments, there is also the option to configure the Hive Metastore to use an external database, supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.15  
* **Kubernetes Deployment:** Denodo Embedded MPP is architected to run on Kubernetes, an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.15 A recommended deployment topology involves an N+2 node architecture. This includes one node dedicated to the MPP coordinator, which is responsible for managing query execution; one node for the embedded Hive Metastore and its PostgreSQL instance; and N worker nodes that perform the actual parallel processing of data.15  
* **Object Storage Connectivity:** The MPP engine within Denodo is designed to directly access data stored in a variety of distributed object storage systems. This includes popular options such as Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Google Cloud Storage, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), as well as any storage system that is S3-compatible.10 This broad connectivity ensures that organizations can leverage their existing data lake infrastructure with Denodo MPP.  
* **Catalogs:** To organize and manage the tables within the MPP engine, Denodo utilizes the concept of catalogs. These catalogs provide a namespace for schemas and tables. Examples of default catalogs include 'iceberg' for tables in the Apache Iceberg format, 'hive' for traditional Hive tables, and 'delta' for tables in the Delta Lake format.10 This logical organization helps in managing the diverse datasets typically found in a data lake.  
* **External Metastore Support:** While Denodo MPP includes an embedded Hive Metastore, it also offers the flexibility to connect to an external metastore. This is particularly useful in organizations that already have a centralized metadata management system, such as an external Hive Metastore or the AWS Glue Data Catalog. By connecting to an external metastore, Denodo MPP can leverage existing metadata definitions, ensuring consistency and reducing administrative overhead.10

The architectural design of Denodo MPP is specifically tailored to optimize performance in data lake environments. By clearly separating metadata management through the Hive Metastore from the physical storage of data in object storage, and by employing a scalable compute engine like Presto, Denodo facilitates efficient processing and analysis of large volumes of often unstructured or semi-structured data. The integration of these components within the Denodo Platform provides a simplified and cohesive approach to managing the complexities of modern data landscapes.

### **How Denodo MPP Enables Parallel Processing**

The Denodo query optimizer plays a pivotal role in enabling parallel processing with Denodo MPP. It is specifically configured to recognize and utilize the embedded MPP engine to accelerate query execution.12 The 'embedded\_mpp' data source, created during the MPP deployment, serves as the primary conduit through which the optimizer interacts with the Presto-based engine.13 When a query is submitted to Denodo that involves data residing in object storage, the optimizer analyzes the query and the characteristics of the underlying data sources. If it determines that leveraging the MPP engine will lead to improved performance, it can push down certain data processing tasks to Presto.12 This pushdown mechanism allows for the parallel execution of query operations directly on the data stored in the object storage.12 The MPP engine can access the data in the object storage using its own optimized engine. Furthermore, for data that resides outside of the object storage, the MPP engine can access it in a streaming manner through the Denodo server, eliminating the need for the creation of intermediate temporary tables or files.19 This capability allows the Denodo query engine to combine its powerful optimization techniques, data federation capabilities, and robust security features with the parallel processing power of the MPP engine when dealing with big data.19 The intelligent query optimizer's ability to decide when and how to best utilize the MPP engine ensures that parallel processing is applied effectively, leading to significant improvements in performance without requiring manual intervention or complex configurations.

## **Performance and Scalability Advantages of Denodo MPP**

### **Quantifiable and qualitative benefits for query execution**

Denodo MPP significantly enhances query performance, particularly when dealing with substantial volumes of data.10 The embedded Presto-based MPP engine combines the inherent scalability of data lake processing with sophisticated optimization techniques, resulting in a powerful platform for data analysis.14 This integration facilitates seamless parallel query execution across a diverse range of data sources, including those located in the cloud and within on-premises environments.14 By distributing the workload across multiple processing units, the MPP engine substantially reduces the time required to retrieve and analyze data, especially for complex queries that involve large datasets.14 Real-world implementations have demonstrated notable performance improvements, such as accelerated query speeds when working with lakehouses 5 and significant speedups in specific analytical scenarios.20 Benchmark testing has even shown that the Denodo Platform, when equipped with MPP, can achieve results comparable to those of physical data warehouses, but with the added advantages of lower costs and faster time-to-value.3 To further optimize query execution, Denodo MPP incorporates features like dynamic filtering, which avoids reading unnecessary data; pushdown filters, which make table scans more efficient; and "quick stats," which build statistics from metadata when they are missing, helping the query planner to create better execution plans.21 Moreover, the platform offers the option to enable vectorized readings, a technique that can lead to further performance gains, especially in scenarios involving complex data types.21

### **Scalability aspects for growing data volumes**

The architecture of Denodo MPP is inherently scalable, designed to effectively handle increasing volumes of data and growing query complexity.14 The MPP architecture distributes the processing workload across multiple independent units, allowing the system to scale horizontally by simply adding more resources as needed.14 Denodo provides recommendations for initial cluster sizing, suggesting a starting point of a certain number of worker nodes, and advises scaling the cluster based on the specific workload requirements.18 Ensuring that the cluster has sufficient memory and CPU cores is crucial for maintaining optimal performance, particularly when the system is handling concurrent queries from multiple users.18 To further enhance resource management and cost efficiency, Denodo MPP supports autoscaling capabilities. This allows the system to automatically adjust the number of active worker nodes based on the current demand, ensuring that resources are utilized effectively and that performance is maintained even during peak loads.23 This scalability ensures that the Denodo Platform can continue to deliver high performance as an organization's data needs evolve and expand.
