Microsoft Fabric presents itself as a unified analytics platform designed to address the diverse data and analytics needs of modern organizations.1 This report delves into the platform's capabilities across several key areas, including its integration with Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory (ADF), its role-based access control (RBAC) model leveraging Entra authentication, its ability to connect to legacy on-premise data sources, its interaction with existing Azure Blob Storage accounts, and the feasibility of porting existing Databricks and ADF pipelines along with Spark processes. The research indicates that Microsoft Fabric offers robust integration capabilities with both Azure Databricks and ADF, providing various methods to connect, orchestrate, and leverage existing investments. Its security model, built on Azure Entra ID, offers granular control over access to data and resources. While Fabric supports connectivity to a range of legacy on-premise systems through a data gateway, specific connectors may have limitations. Utilizing existing Azure Blob Storage with OneLake is facilitated through shortcuts, offering benefits like centralized access and reduced data duplication, though cost and control considerations are important. Porting existing pipelines and Spark processes involves a degree of compatibility, but often requires manual effort and thorough assessment. Overall, Microsoft Fabric appears to be a promising platform, particularly for organizations deeply invested in the Microsoft ecosystem, offering a unified environment for various analytics workloads. However, a careful evaluation of specific use cases and existing infrastructure is recommended to fully ascertain its suitability.

## **2\. Microsoft Fabric Integration with Azure Databricks**

Microsoft Fabric offers several avenues for integration with Azure Databricks, catering to different scenarios and user needs. Azure Databricks can establish a connection with Microsoft Fabric OneLake, the platform's unified data lake, by utilizing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) credential passthrough.4 This method streamlines the connection process, allowing Databricks to seamlessly read and write data to OneLake. However, a prerequisite for this approach is that the Azure Databricks workspace must be of the premium tier.4 This requirement might necessitate an upgrade or incur additional costs for organizations currently using the standard tier of Databricks. Alternatively, a connection can be established using a service principal, which proves particularly useful in scenarios where Azure Databricks and Microsoft Fabric reside on different tenants, providing a controlled and secure method for cross-tenant resource access.4

Within Microsoft Fabric itself, the Data Factory component features an Azure Databricks activity, enabling the orchestration of various Azure Databricks jobs directly from Fabric pipelines.6 This activity supports the execution of Databricks notebooks, JAR files, Python scripts, and even existing Databricks Jobs, offering a centralized platform for managing complex data workflows that span across both services.6 When configuring this activity, users have the flexibility to choose between creating a new job cluster, connecting to an existing interactive cluster, or utilizing an existing instance pool within their Azure Databricks environment.6 Furthermore, the activity provides options to configure cluster policies and specify the Unity Catalog access mode, enhancing both governance and security.6 This capability to orchestrate Databricks jobs from Fabric pipelines suggests a potential for unified workflow management, allowing users to leverage the specialized processing power of Databricks within the broader context of Fabric's data integration capabilities.

Another integration possibility involves mirroring an existing Azure Databricks Unity Catalog within Microsoft Fabric.8 This feature allows users to access and analyze their data managed by Unity Catalog directly within Fabric without the need for data movement or duplication. However, it's important to note a significant limitation: the mirroring process does not currently replicate the security configurations defined in Unity Catalog.9 This implies a potential security gap if organizations rely solely on mirroring for integration in governed environments. Lastly, users can also publish Databricks tables directly to Power BI datasets from the Databricks workspace.10 This direct integration pathway supports different dataset modes, such as DirectQuery and Import, and various authentication methods, including OAuth and Personal Access Tokens (PAT).10 Publishing to Power BI directly from Databricks offers a streamlined approach for business intelligence consumption of Databricks data, potentially bypassing the need for Fabric in certain analytical scenarios.

While these integration methods offer flexibility, certain limitations and specific configurations must be considered. For mirrored databases, network limitations exist, such as the lack of support for private endpoints or IP Access lists for Databricks workspaces.11 Additionally, the integration is contingent on using supported Spark versions within Fabric.11 Certain types of Databricks tables, including those with Row-Level Security (RLS) or Column-Level Security (CLM) policies, streaming tables, views, and materialized views, are not supported for mirroring.11 These limitations highlight the importance of careful planning to ensure the chosen integration method aligns with the specific Databricks assets and organizational requirements.

For optimal integration, several best practices can be followed. When both Fabric and Databricks are within the same tenant and a premium Databricks workspace is available, utilizing the ADLS credential passthrough offers a simpler connection experience.4 In cross-tenant or more controlled access scenarios, employing service principals provides a robust and secure solution.5 Organizations can leverage the Azure Databricks activity within Fabric Data Factory to orchestrate complex data workflows that involve both platforms, capitalizing on the strengths of each service.6 A hybrid approach, where Databricks is used for heavy processing and Fabric for orchestration and business intelligence, might prove to be the most effective strategy for many organizations.

## **3\. Microsoft Fabric Integration with Azure Data Factory (ADF)**

Microsoft Fabric's Data Factory provides a comprehensive suite of tools for data integration, offering capabilities for workflow orchestration, data movement, data replication, and data transformation that are comparable to those found in Azure Data Factory (ADF).13 For organizations with existing investments in ADF, Fabric offers the ability to bring entire ADF instances into a Fabric workspace as an "Azure Data Factory" item.17 This feature allows users to manage and monitor their existing ADF pipelines directly from within the Fabric environment. It is important to note that, in this scenario, the existing ADF pipelines continue to run on Azure, providing a seamless way to integrate existing workloads with the new Fabric platform.17 Furthermore, Fabric includes an "Invoke pipeline activity" which can be used to trigger existing ADF pipelines, enabling the leveraging of ADF-specific features that might not yet be available in Fabric.13 This capability is particularly useful during a phased migration or when specific ADF functionalities are required.

However, direct migration of ADF pipelines, specifically their JSON definitions, to Fabric pipelines is not currently supported.13 Organizations looking to move their pipeline logic to Fabric will need to recreate the pipelines from scratch within the Fabric Data Factory interface.13 This process is further complicated by slight differences in the underlying JSON definitions between the two platforms, meaning a simple copy-paste approach is not feasible.13 Similarly, ADF "data flows," which are built on Synapse Spark, are not directly compatible with Fabric "dataflows," which are built on Power Query.13 This incompatibility necessitates a re-engineering effort for data transformation logic if organizations wish to utilize Fabric's native dataflow capabilities.

Fabric offers its own native data orchestration tool in the form of Fabric Data Pipelines.13 These pipelines are similar in concept to ADF pipelines but are deeply integrated with the Fabric ecosystem, providing seamless connectivity to OneLake, Data Warehouse, and other Fabric components.13 Fabric also features a "Copy job," which offers a simplified user interface for quickly and easily moving data between various supported connectors.16 For data transformation, Fabric provides Dataflow Gen2, a tool built on the familiar Power Query interface.15 Dataflow Gen2 offers a user-friendly, low-code environment with a wide array of transformation capabilities and supports various output destinations, including Lakehouse and Data Warehouse.23 This tool caters to a broader range of users, including business analysts, for performing data transformation tasks within the Fabric platform.

For organizations considering a move from ADF to Fabric, several best practices can be considered. For new projects that are being developed within the Fabric ecosystem, it is generally recommended to utilize the native Fabric Data Factory pipelines and Dataflow Gen2 as the primary orchestration and transformation tools.26 For organizations with substantial existing ADF investments, a more pragmatic approach might involve initially mounting the ADF instance within Fabric to gain a centralized view and gradually rebuilding critical pipelines as needed, taking advantage of Fabric's integrated capabilities.17 During this transition, the "Invoke pipeline activity" can be a valuable tool for bridging any functional gaps by allowing Fabric pipelines to call existing ADF pipelines that might leverage ADF-specific features.13 A well-defined and strategic migration plan is essential to ensure a smooth transition, minimize disruption to existing data workflows, and ultimately maximize the benefits of adopting the Microsoft Fabric platform.

## **4\. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Microsoft Fabric using Entra Authentication**

Microsoft Fabric's security model is deeply integrated with Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for both authentication and authorization, providing a robust framework for managing access to the platform and its data.29 The authentication flow begins with a user or service principal name (SPN) authenticating through Entra ID, which in turn issues an access token. Fabric then utilizes this token to verify the identity of the requester and authorize their actions within the platform.29 This reliance on Entra ID provides a centralized and secure identity management system that aligns with standard Azure security practices.

Access to resources within Microsoft Fabric is primarily controlled through workspace roles.29 Fabric offers four distinct workspace roles, each with a specific set of capabilities: **Admin**, **Member**, **Contributor**, and **Viewer**. Admins possess the highest level of control, capable of managing all aspects of the workspace, including permissions. Members have extensive rights to create and manage content, while Contributors can create and edit content but with more restricted administrative capabilities. Viewers have read-only access to the workspace content. These workspace roles can be assigned to individual users or to security groups managed within Entra ID directly through the Fabric portal.43 This integration with Entra ID groups simplifies the management of access for teams and departments, allowing administrators to efficiently grant permissions to multiple users simultaneously. For more granular control, Fabric also supports item-level permissions, enabling the management of access to individual Fabric items within a workspace.29

Beyond workspace and item-level permissions, Fabric offers compute permissions within specific compute engines, such as the SQL analytics endpoint and semantic models. These permissions allow for even finer-grained data access control, including table and row-level security.29 Furthermore, OneLake, Fabric's unified data lake, provides OneLake data access roles, which allow for the creation of custom roles within a lakehouse and the granting of read permissions to specific folders.29 This data-centric approach to security within the lakehouse enables precise control over who can access specific data assets.

The end-to-end authorization flow in Microsoft Fabric involves a sequential evaluation of security levels.29 First, the user's identity is verified through Entra authentication. Next, the system checks if the user has the necessary permissions to access Microsoft Fabric itself. Finally, it determines if the user is authorized to perform the requested action on the specific data or resource based on their assigned workspace roles, item permissions, and OneLake data access roles.29 Fabric also supports Row-Level Security (RLS) and Column-Level Security (CLS), which allow for filtering data based on user roles, ensuring that users only see the information they are authorized to view.29 This comprehensive security model, deeply integrated with Entra ID, provides organizations with granular control over access to their data and resources within Microsoft Fabric.

To effectively implement RBAC in Microsoft Fabric, organizations should develop a clear strategy that aligns with their overall security policies and the specific responsibilities of their users.53 Utilizing Entra ID security groups for managing access is a best practice, as it simplifies administration compared to assigning roles to individual users.31 For lakehouses, leveraging OneLake data access roles allows for fine-grained control over data access within specific folders.29 Implementing RLS and CLS is crucial for restricting data access at the row and column levels when dealing with sensitive information.29 Finally, it is essential to regularly review and audit role assignments to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.52

## **5\. Connecting Microsoft Fabric to Legacy On-Premise Data Sources**

Microsoft Fabric's Data Factory offers connectivity to a range of on-premise data sources, enabling organizations to integrate their legacy systems with the unified analytics platform.59 This includes support for common legacy systems such as Mainframe (via IBM DB2) 59, Oracle 59, and SFTP.61 Overall, Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric supports a significant number of data pipeline connectors, totaling 55 based on current documentation.61 This broad connectivity facilitates hybrid data integration scenarios, allowing organizations to leverage their existing data assets regardless of their location.

To establish a connection with on-premise data sources, Microsoft Fabric relies on an On-Premises Data Gateway.59 This gateway acts as a secure bridge between the on-premise environment and the Fabric service in the cloud. Installing and configuring the data gateway requires meeting certain minimum and recommended requirements. The minimum requirements include a 64-bit version of Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019,.NET Framework 4.8, and 4GB of disk space.78 For optimal performance, the recommended specifications include an 8-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, Windows Server 2019 or later, and SSD storage for spooling.78 The data gateway initiates outbound connections to Azure Relay for cloud connectivity and requires specific outbound ports to be open on the gateway server's firewall to function correctly.56 The data gateway is a critical component for enabling hybrid connectivity, and its requirements should be carefully considered during infrastructure planning.

While Fabric offers connectors for legacy systems, there are certain limitations and prerequisites to be aware of. For instance, the SFTP connector currently only supports Basic authentication.71 Using the Oracle connector in data pipelines necessitates the installation of the Oracle Client for Microsoft Tools (OCMT) on the machine hosting the data gateway.70 The IBM DB2 connector may also have specific limitations related to driver compatibility and the need for certain permissions within the DB2 environment.79 Understanding these connector-specific limitations and prerequisites is essential for ensuring successful and reliable connectivity to legacy on-premise data sources.

To optimize the connection to on-premise data sources, several best practices can be followed. It is generally recommended to dedicate a machine or a virtual machine (VM) to run the on-premises data gateway to ensure isolation and proper resource management.76 Organizations should also ensure that proper network connectivity and firewall rules are configured to allow the gateway to communicate effectively with both the on-premise data sources and the Microsoft Fabric service in the cloud.56 For scenarios involving multiple users and data sources, using the gateway in standard mode is advisable.78 Finally, for optimal performance, it is important to consider the sizing guidelines for the gateway machine based on the anticipated workload and data volumes.83

## **6\. Utilizing Existing Azure Blob Storage with Microsoft OneLake**

Microsoft OneLake, the unified data lake at the heart of Fabric, is built upon the foundation of Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2.1 This architectural decision ensures that OneLake inherently supports the same ADLS Gen2 APIs and SDKs, providing a degree of familiarity and compatibility for users already working within the Azure storage ecosystem.4 This underlying compatibility can ease the transition to OneLake for organizations that have established data lakes in Azure Blob Storage.

One of the key features facilitating the integration of existing Azure Blob Storage with OneLake is the "Shortcut" functionality.1 Shortcuts allow users to create symbolic links within OneLake that point to external storage locations, including Azure Blob Storage containers. This enables Fabric to access data residing in existing Blob Storage accounts without the need to physically move or duplicate the data, potentially leading to significant cost savings and simplified data management.5 Shortcuts to Azure Blob Storage can be created within a Fabric lakehouse or a KQL database, providing flexibility in how the external data is integrated into the Fabric environment.77 Furthermore, users can connect Azure Storage Explorer, a familiar tool for managing Azure storage resources, directly to OneLake by using the designated OneLake URI, allowing for easy exploration and management of data within the unified data lake.99 The URI syntax for accessing OneLake follows a specific format that includes the workspace name, item name, and item type, or alternatively, globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for the workspace and item.57

Utilizing existing Azure Blob Storage with OneLake offers several benefits. It provides centralized data access across the entire organization through the unified OneLake, breaking down data silos and simplifying data discovery.1 The use of shortcuts minimizes data movement and duplication, leading to potential cost efficiencies and reduced complexity in data pipelines.5 The inherent compatibility with ADLS Gen2 APIs and tools ensures a smoother transition for existing Azure users.4 Additionally, OneLake's underlying architecture may offer performance improvements for certain workloads.106 However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Accessing data in OneLake might incur costs related to Fabric capacity, particularly for frequent or intensive operations.9 As a SaaS service, OneLake offers less granular control over the underlying storage compared to the PaaS model of ADLS Gen2.92 There might also be specific limitations, such as potential issues with deleting files or folders with uppercase workspace names when using Storage Explorer.99

For organizations looking to leverage their existing Azure Blob Storage with Microsoft OneLake, several best practices can be considered. Structuring data within OneLake in a logical manner, potentially following a medallion architecture, can improve data organization and query performance.4 Utilizing shortcuts to reference existing Blob Storage data is a practical approach when direct migration is not feasible or desired.5 If querying data from different geographical regions, consider using the regional OneLake endpoints to ensure data locality and minimize latency.57 For transferring large volumes of data, exploring the use of command-line tools like AzCopy can offer efficiency and speed.93

## **7\. Porting Existing Databricks/ADF Pipelines and Spark Processes to Microsoft Fabric**

When considering the adoption of Microsoft Fabric, organizations with existing data pipelines in Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory (ADF) will naturally inquire about the feasibility of porting these assets to the new platform. Regarding ADF pipelines, Fabric offers the capability to bring them into the Fabric workspace as an "Azure Data Factory" item, allowing for centralized management and monitoring.17 However, it's crucial to understand that these pipelines continue to execute within the Azure environment, not on Fabric compute.17 Fabric also provides an "Invoke pipeline activity" that can be used to trigger existing ADF pipelines, enabling a degree of interoperability and allowing organizations to leverage their prior investments.13 Despite these integration points, direct import or migration of ADF pipeline JSON definitions to Fabric pipelines is not currently supported, necessitating a manual recreation of the pipeline logic within the Fabric Data Factory interface.13 Furthermore, Databricks pipelines, specifically those created using Delta Live Tables (DLT), cannot be directly mirrored into Fabric, potentially requiring workarounds involving the creation of standard Delta tables to access the underlying data.108

Microsoft Fabric includes a managed Apache Spark environment, which offers a degree of compatibility with existing Databricks Spark processes.1 Fabric supports several Apache Spark runtime versions, which may or may not align with the specific version used in an organization's Databricks environment.109 While the core Spark functionality is generally compatible, potential issues might arise due to differences in the availability and versions of runtime libraries and the support for certain Spark features.9 Therefore, a thorough compatibility assessment and potential code adjustments might be necessary when porting existing Databricks Spark processes to Fabric. To facilitate data interaction, Fabric provides a Spark connector for Fabric Data Warehouse, enabling Spark developers to access and manipulate data residing in Fabric warehouses and lakehouses.121 This connector offers a simplified API for interacting with Fabric's data stores from a Spark environment.

For organizations planning to port existing pipelines and Spark processes, several best practices can be considered. For ADF pipelines, a phased migration approach might be the most practical, initially leveraging the "Invoke pipeline activity" to maintain critical workflows while gradually rebuilding pipelines using Fabric's native capabilities.13 When porting Databricks Spark processes, it is advisable to begin by evaluating the compatibility of the existing code with the supported Fabric Spark runtime versions and thoroughly testing key functionalities in a non-production environment.109 Utilizing the Spark connector for Fabric Data Warehouse can streamline the process of accessing and processing data within the Fabric ecosystem from Spark environments.121 For new development within the Fabric platform, it is generally recommended to leverage Fabric's native data engineering tools, including Data Pipelines, Dataflow Gen2, and Spark notebooks, to take full advantage of the platform's integrated capabilities.16 A hybrid approach, where existing pipelines are maintained and integrated while new development utilizes Fabric's native features, might be a pragmatic strategy for many organizations during their adoption journey.
