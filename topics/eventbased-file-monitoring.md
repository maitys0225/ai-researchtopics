To orchestrate an event-based workflow in Azure where a Databricks job runs **only after 10 prerequisite files are successfully created** in a data lake, use **Azure Event Grid**, **Azure Functions**, and **Azure Cosmos DB** (for state tracking). Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Prerequisite Setup**
1. **Prerequisite Jobs**: Ensure each of the 10 independent jobs writes its output file to an **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)** path (e.g., `prerequisites/file_1.csv`).
2. **Event Grid Integration**: Enable **Azure Event Grid** to monitor the ADLS container for blob creation events.

---

### **2. Configure Event Grid for File Creation Events**
1. **Create an Event Grid Subscription** to listen for blob creation events in your ADLS container:
   - **Event Types**: `Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated`
   - **Scope**: Filter events to your ADLS container (e.g., `/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{account}/blobServices/default/containers/{container}`).
   - **Subject Filter**: Use a prefix to track only prerequisite files (e.g., `prerequisites/file_`).

### **3. Create an Azure Function to Track File Events**
Deploy an **Azure Function** (Python or C#) triggered by Event Grid. The function will:
1. Check if the created blob is one of the 10 prerequisite files.
2. Update a **Cosmos DB** document to track which files are ready.
3. Trigger the main Databricks job once all 10 files exist.

#### **Sample Function Code (Python)**
```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func
from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
import requests

# Initialize Cosmos DB client
cosmos_client = CosmosClient(
    "YOUR_COSMOSDB_URI",
    credential="YOUR_COSMOSDB_KEY"
)
database = cosmos_client.get_database_client("file-tracking-db")
container = database.get_container_client("prerequisites")

# List of required files
required_files = [f"file_{i}.csv" for i in range(1, 11)]

def main(event: func.EventGridEvent):
    # Extract blob URL from the event
    blob_url = event.get_json()["url"]
    file_name = blob_url.split("/")[-1]

    # Check if the file is a prerequisite
    if file_name not in required_files:
        return

    # Update Cosmos DB to track the file
    document_id = "current_execution" # Use a unique ID per pipeline run
    try:
        document = container.read_item(document_id, document_id)
    except:
        # Initialize document if it doesn't exist
        document = {
            "id": document_id,
            "files_received": []
        }

    if file_name not in document["files_received"]:
        document["files_received"].append(file_name)
        container.upsert_item(document)

    # Check if all files are ready
    if set(document["files_received"]) == set(required_files):
        # Trigger Databricks job
        databricks_api_url = "https://<databricks-instance>/api/2.1/jobs/run-now"
        headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <DATABRICKS_PAT>"}
        payload = {"job_id": "<MAIN_JOB_ID>"}
        response = requests.post(databricks_api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()

        # Reset tracking for the next run (optional)
        document["files_received"] = []
        container.upsert_item(document)
```

---

### **4. Configure Azure Cosmos DB**
1. **Create a Cosmos DB Account** with a container named `prerequisites`.
2. **Store Tracking State**: Use a document (e.g., `current_execution`) to track received files.

---

### **5. Secure Credentials**
1. **Databricks PAT**: Store the Personal Access Token in **Azure Key Vault** and retrieve it in the function using `DefaultAzureCredential()`.
2. **Cosmos DB Key**: Use Key Vault or Managed Identity for secure access.

---

### **6. Trigger Logic Flow**
1. **Prerequisite Job Completion** → File written to ADLS.
2. **Event Grid** detects the blob creation → Triggers the Azure Function.
3. **Azure Function** updates Cosmos DB → Checks if all files are received.
4. **Main Databricks Job** is triggered via API call.

---

### **7. Handle Edge Cases**
- **Idempotency**: Use Cosmos DB to avoid duplicate processing (e.g., track filenames, not just counts).
- **Concurrent Runs**: Use a unique `document_id` (e.g., timestamp) for each pipeline execution if parallel runs are allowed.
- **Failure Handling**: Add retries and dead-letter queues for Event Grid events.

### **Architecture Diagram**
```
Prerequisite Jobs → ADLS (File Creation) → Event Grid → Azure Function
                     ↑ ↓
                   Cosmos DB (State) Trigger Main Job
```

---

### **Key Benefits**
- **Event-Driven**: No polling; the workflow reacts to file creation events.
- **Scalable**: Handles thousands of files and concurrent executions.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for triggered events and function executions.

By combining Azure Event Grid, Functions, and Cosmos DB, you create a resilient, event-driven pipeline that ensures the main Databricks job runs only when all dependencies are met.
