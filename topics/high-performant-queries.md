The cost implications of using Databricks for large-scale data processing are significant and depend on several factors:

1. Data Volume: Larger data volumes require more processing power, leading to higher costs. Processing 20 TB of data will cost approximately five times more than processing 4 TB[1].

2. Databricks Units (DBUs): Databricks charges based on DBUs, which represent computation consumption. The cost per DBU varies depending on the workload type and chosen plan, ranging from $0.40 to $0.75 per DBU[2][3].

3. Workload Complexity: More complex data and algorithms lead to higher DBU consumption and, consequently, increased costs[2].

4. Data Velocity: For streaming data, higher throughput increases DBU usage and costs[2].

5. Cluster Configuration: The type of cluster (e.g., All-Purpose, ML Compute optimized) and its size significantly impact costs. Running a small cluster 24/7 can cost around $2.64/hour[5].

6. Cloud Provider Costs: In addition to Databricks fees, users must pay for the underlying cloud infrastructure. For example, a team reported paying $1900 for AWS EC2 costs and $700 for S3 GET requests, on top of $2500 for Databricks SQL engine[5].

7. Storage Costs: Data storage expenses can accumulate, especially when dealing with large datasets and Delta Lake optimizations[4].

While Databricks offers a pay-as-you-go model, which can be cost-effective for some organizations, large-scale data processing can lead to significant expenses. Some companies report monthly costs around $5000 for querying and dashboards across their business[5].

To optimize costs, organizations can use the Databricks DBU Calculator to estimate expenses based on their specific workloads and experiment with different scenarios[2]. Additionally, careful configuration of auto-scaling, proper cluster management, and optimizing storage usage can help control costs in large-scale data processing environments[4].
