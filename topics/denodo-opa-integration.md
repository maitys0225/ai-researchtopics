While Denodo doesn’t provide a dedicated, out‑of‑the‑box connector for Open Policy Agent (OPA), you can integrate them by leveraging Denodo’s robust API capabilities and extensibility. Here’s how that integration can work:

1. **REST API Invocation:**  
   Denodo exposes data through REST, OData, and GraphQL services. You can configure Denodo to call external REST endpoints during query processing. In this integration scenario, Denodo sends a security context (such as user credentials, roles, and resource metadata) as part of an API request to OPA’s evaluation endpoint (e.g., using a POST request to `/v1/data/<policy-path>`). OPA then evaluates this input against its Rego policies and returns a decision (allow/deny or even a data filter).

2. **Policy Decision Enforcement:**  
   Once Denodo receives the decision from OPA, it can enforce it by either blocking the query or by dynamically applying data filters based on the policy outcome. This enables you to centralize and standardize your security and access control logic across multiple data sources.

3. **Centralized Governance and Auditing:**  
   Integrating OPA allows you to manage and audit policy decisions centrally. Denodo’s metadata and governance features can be augmented by logging the OPA decisions, thereby ensuring compliance and providing an auditable trail.

4. **Custom Scripting or Connector Development:**  
   If needed, you can build custom connectors or scripts within Denodo to trigger OPA policy evaluation as part of the query lifecycle. This custom integration enables more complex use cases, such as dynamic policy updates or contextual access control based on real‑time data.

This integration approach takes advantage of OPA’s policy‑as‑code framework (using Rego) while utilizing Denodo’s data virtualization and API management features to enforce consistent, fine‑grained security across your data landscape.
