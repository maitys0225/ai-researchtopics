Here are modern alternatives to **Autosys** for orchestrating dependent jobs/files across teams and processes, especially when prerequisites are generated by different teams or systems:

---

### **1. Cloud-Native Orchestrators**
#### **a. AWS Step Functions + EventBridge**
- **Use Case**: Trigger jobs when files land in S3 (from multiple teams).
- **Workflow**:
  1. Use **S3 Event Notifications** to publish events to **EventBridge** when files are created.
  2. **Step Functions** tracks events and triggers the final job once all 10 files are detected.
  3. Integrate with **AWS Lambda** or **Glue** for file validation.
- **Pros**: Serverless, scalable, and native to AWS.

#### **b. Azure Logic Apps + Event Grid**
- **Use Case**: File-based triggers in Azure Blob Storage.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Event Grid** monitors Blob Storage for file creation events.
  2. **Logic Apps** aggregates events and triggers the main job via **Databricks Jobs API**.
  3. Track state in **Azure Table Storage** or **Cosmos DB**.
- **Pros**: Low-code, integrates with Azure services.

#### **c. Google Cloud Composer (Airflow)**
- **Use Case**: Multi-team workflows with file dependencies in GCS.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Use **Cloud Storage Triggers** to detect file creation.
  2. **Airflow DAGs** (Directed Acyclic Graphs) with `GCSUbjectExistenceSensor` to wait for files.
  3. Trigger downstream jobs (e.g., BigQuery, Dataproc).
- **Pros**: Fully managed Airflow, supports hybrid clouds.

---

### **2. Open-Source Workflow Managers**
#### **a. Apache Airflow**
- **Use Case**: Complex dependencies across teams using shared storage (e.g., S3, HDFS).
- **Workflow**:
  1. Define a DAG with `FileSensor` tasks to poll for files.
  2. Teams publish files to agreed-upon paths.
  3. Once all files exist, trigger the final job (e.g., Spark, SQL).
- **Pros**: Code-first, extensible, supports cross-cloud storage.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from airflow import DAG
  from airflow.sensors.filesystem import FileSensor
  from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator

  with DAG("file_dependent_dag") as dag:
      wait_for_files = [
          FileSensor(
              task_id=f"wait_for_file_{i}",
              filepath=f"/data/team_{i}/file_{i}.csv"
          ) for i in range(1, 11)
      ]
      final_task = DummyOperator(task_id="run_main_job")
      wait_for_files >> final_task
  ```

#### **b. Prefect**
- **Use Case**: Dynamic, event-driven workflows.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Use **Prefect Sensors** to watch for files (e.g., `S3Sensor`).
  2. Teams write files to designated locations.
  3. Trigger flows via **Prefect Cloud** when all files are ready.
- **Pros**: Python-native, lightweight, and modern UI.

---

### **3. Event-Driven Frameworks**
#### **a. Apache Kafka + Kubernetes**
- **Use Case**: Real-time file tracking in distributed systems.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Teams publish "file created" events to a **Kafka topic**.
  2. A **Kubernetes CronJob** or **Knative Service** consumes events and checks for all 10 files.
  3. Trigger the final job via **Argo Workflows** or a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Pros**: Decentralized, scales for high-throughput systems.

#### **b. Delta Live Tables (Databricks)**
- **Use Case**: Data lakehouse automation with file dependencies.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Teams write data to Delta tables in ADLS/S3.
  2. Use **Auto Loader** to detect new files and update tables.
  3. Define pipelines with dependencies using SQL/Python.
- **Pros**: Built-in file tracking, ACID compliance.

---

### **4. Hybrid Solutions**
#### **a. Control-M (BMC)**
- **Use Case**: Enterprise-grade scheduling with file watchers.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Use **File Watchers** to monitor shared storage.
  2. Define job dependencies across teams in Control-M GUI.
  3. Trigger jobs via APIs or scripts.
- **Pros**: Enterprise support, integrates with legacy systems.

#### **b. Luigi (Spotify)**
- **Use Case**: Python-based dependency chains.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Define tasks with `requires()` methods to check for files.
  2. Teams output files to a shared directory.
  3. Run the Luigi server to visualize dependencies.
- **Pros**: Simple, code-first, and lightweight.

By adopting these tools, you can replace Autosys with a modern, scalable, and team-friendly orchestration system.

‐‐‐‐---------‐------------
You're absolutely right—Autosys excels in enterprise-grade features like **shift-based support team notifications** and a centralized portal for operational visibility, which many modern tools (especially open-source ones) lack out of the box. However, you can replicate this functionality by combining **open-source orchestration tools** with **incident management platforms** and **custom integrations**. Here's how:

---

### **1. Open-Source Orchestration Tools with Alerting**
#### **a. Apache Airflow + Plugins**
- **Airflow** itself doesn’t include shift-based alerts, but you can extend it with:
  - **Plugins**: Build a custom plugin to:
    - Fetch on-call schedules from a calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, iCal).
    - Route alerts to the current support team member via Slack/email/PagerDuty.
  - **Operators**: Use `on_failure_callback` in tasks to trigger notifications.
  ```python
  def alert_oncall(context):
      # Fetch current on-call from a shift calendar
      oncall_email = get_current_oncall()
      send_email(to=oncall_email, subject="Task Failed!")

  task = PythonOperator(
      task_id="my_task",
      python_callable=my_function,
      on_failure_callback=alert_oncall,
  )
  ```
- **Integrate with ChatOps**: Use Airflow’s native Slack/Teams webhook integrations.

#### **b. Prefect + Notifications**
- Prefect’s **Automations** allow you to trigger actions (e.g., Slack messages, PagerDuty alerts) based on task failures.
- Use **Prefect Cloud** (free tier available) to:
  - Define alert policies tied to specific flows.
  - Integrate with external shift calendars via API.

---

### **2. Open-Source Incident Management & On-Call Tools**
Pair your orchestration tool with a dedicated **on-call management platform** to handle shift schedules and escalations:

#### **a. Grafana OnCall (Open-Source)**
- **Features**:
  - Manage on-call schedules with rotations.
  - Route alerts to the right person based on shifts.
  - Integrate with Airflow/Prefect via **webhooks**.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Airflow task fails → Trigger webhook to Grafana OnCall.
  2. Grafana OnCall checks the on-call schedule → Notifies the current support member via SMS/Slack/phone call.

#### **b. Alertmanager (Prometheus Stack)**
- **Features**:
  - Group alerts and route them to on-call teams.
  - Supports integrations with PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or custom webhooks.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Use Prometheus to monitor job statuses (e.g., via Airflow metrics).
  2. Alertmanager routes failures to the current shift member.

#### **c. Zabbix**
- **Features**:
  - Built-in escalations and on-call schedules.
  - Integrates with orchestration tools via APIs/scripts.

---

### **3. Custom Portal for Support Teams**
Build a centralized dashboard to monitor jobs and assign support shifts using:
#### **a. **Metabase** or **Grafana****
- Create dashboards showing real-time job statuses.
- Embed links to incident management tools (e.g., Grafana OnCall).

#### **b. **Rundeck** (Open-Source)**
- **Features**:
  - Job scheduling + operational visibility.
  - Define workflows with approval steps and notifications.
  - Integrates with LDAP/SSO for team access control.
- **Portal**: Offers a self-service UI for support teams to view job logs and handle failures.

#### **c. **NetBox** + Custom Scripts**
- Use NetBox (IT infrastructure tool) to track team shifts.
- Build a simple Flask/Django portal to display jobs and on-call info.

---

### **4. Shift-Based Notifications Example**
Here’s how to implement shift-based alerts using **Apache Airflow + Grafana OnCall**:
1. **Store Shift Schedules**:
   - Use a Google Sheet/Calendar shared across teams.
   - Sync shifts with Grafana OnCall via its API.
2. **Airflow DAG**:
   ```python
   from airflow import DAG
   from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
   from datetime import datetime
   import requests

   def notify_oncall(context):
       # Get current on-call from Grafana OnCall API
       response = requests.get("https://oncall-api/fetch-oncall")
       oncall_user = response.json()["email"]
       # Send alert via Slack/Email
       send_slack_message(f"Task failed! Notify {oncall_user}")

   with DAG("shift_aware_dag", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1)) as dag:
       task = PythonOperator(
           task_id="my_task",
           python_callable=my_task_function,
           on_failure_callback=notify_oncall,
       )
   ```

---

### **5. Enterprise Open-Source Alternatives**
#### **a. StackStorm**
- **Features**:
  - Event-driven automation with workflows (like Autosys).
  - Built-in chatops (Slack/Microsoft Teams).
  - Define policies to alert specific users based on schedules.
- **Portal**: Use its web UI or integrate with Grafana.

#### **b. **N8N** (Self-Hostable)**
- Low-code workflow automation with shift-based logic.
- **Example**:
  - Trigger an n8n workflow when a job fails.
  - Use the **Google Calendar node** to check who’s on call.
  - Send alerts via the **Slack node**.

### **Comparison: Autosys vs. Open-Source Stack**
| **Feature** | **Autosys** | **Open-Source Alternative** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shift Management** | Built-in | Grafana OnCall + Google Calendar |
| **Centralized Portal** | Native UI | Grafana/Metabase + Custom Dashboard |
| **Notifications** | Integrated | Airflow/Prefect + Alertmanager/Grafana OnCall |
| **Access Control** | Role-based (LDAP) | Keycloak/OpenLDAP + Orchestration Tool |
| **Cost** | Licensing fees | Free (with self-hosting/maintenance effort) |

---

### **Recommendation**
1. **For Shift Alerts**: Use **Grafana OnCall** (open-source) or **Opsgenie** (free tier) to manage on-call schedules and escalations.
2. **For Orchestration**: **Apache Airflow** or **Prefect** for job dependencies.
3. **For Portal**: Build a dashboard with **Grafana** or **Metabase** and embed incident management UIs.

While no single open-source tool replicates Autosys’s end-to-end experience, this combo provides **greater flexibility** and avoids vendor lock-in. Enterprises like Spotify and Airbnb use similar stacks for large-scale, team-agnostic workflows.
