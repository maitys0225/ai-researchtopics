Perfect, thanks for the clarification! I will research Azure-native and open-source alternatives to Autosys, ensuring they support centralized orchestration across multiple Azure subscriptions, are primarily code-first, and prefer fully managed services (but I'll include hosting options where necessary). I'll prioritize modern, scalable, and enterprise-ready solutions.

I'll get started and update you shortly with a detailed analysis and recommendations!

# Replacing AutoSys with Azure-Native and Open-Source Orchestration Solutions

## Executive Summary
Organizations running legacy job schedulers like **AutoSys** are seeking modern, cloud-aligned orchestration tools. This report explores how to replace AutoSys with Azure-native and open-source orchestrators that offer **centralized multi-subscription control**, a **code-first (DevOps-friendly) approach**, and preferably **fully managed (PaaS)** services. We evaluate Azure services (Data Factory, Logic Apps, Durable Functions) and open-source tools (Apache Airflow, Prefect, Argo Workflows), providing a detailed comparison, sample architectures, and a migration strategy.

## Introduction
AutoSys currently provides centralized scheduling for multiple applications across Azure subscriptions via on-host agents. An orchestration system **coordinates job execution, schedules tasks, and manages dependencies** in workflows. However, AutoSys's older architecture and proprietary setup can limit agility.

### AutoSys in the Current Architecture
AutoSys (CA Workload Automation) is an enterprise-grade job scheduler known for its reliability in orchestrating complex, business-critical workflows across heterogeneous environments:

- Uses a **centralized scheduler and database** (AutoSys server) to manage job definitions, triggers, and dependencies
- Deploys lightweight **AutoSys agents** on each target system to execute jobs and report status
- Excels in **time-based scheduling, dependency chaining, event triggers, and notifications**
- Provides a **central portal** with unified view of all jobs
- Offers enterprise features like calendar management and **shift-based on-call notifications**

#### Limitations of AutoSys
- Proprietary, legacy solution requiring dedicated infrastructure and licensing costs
- Not cloud-native; not designed with cloud PaaS scaling or DevOps in mind
- Uses proprietary JIL syntax rather than common programming languages
- **Lacks out-of-the-box integrations** with modern cloud services
- Represents a **"niche enterprise solution"** with a limited talent pool

---

## Key Requirements for a Modern Orchestrator

To successfully replace AutoSys, any alternative must meet these requirements:

1. **Centralized Orchestration Across Multiple Subscriptions**
   - Coordinate jobs spanning several Azure subscriptions
   - Handle cross-subscription authentication and network connectivity
   - Support distributed agent model similar to AutoSys

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Support complex dependencies (job A triggers job B on success)
   - Handle fan-in/fan-out of parallel tasks and conditional logic
   - Ensure jobs can wait for outputs from multiple other jobs

3. **Code-First Approach**
   - Define workflows as code (Python, .NET, YAML)
   - Enable version control, code reviews, and CI/CD for orchestrations
   - Favor developer-friendly tools over purely GUI-driven solutions

4. **Managed Service (PaaS) if Possible**
   - Reduce operational overhead with cloud-managed solutions
   - Minimize server management and patching requirements

5. **Integration with Azure Services**
   - Easily trigger Azure resources (Data Factory, Databricks, Functions, VMs)
   - Handle Azure identities and security models
   - Support integration with Azure services via SDKs, CLI, or API calls

6. **Scalability and Reliability**
   - Handle the scale of current workloads (potentially thousands of jobs)
   - Provide high availability and fault tolerance
   - Support retry mechanisms and checkpointing for long processes

7. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Provide centralized dashboard to track jobs, successes/failures, and logs
   - Support alerting on failures or SLA breaches

8. **Cost-effectiveness**
   - Reduce or eliminate licensing costs
   - Favor open-source or pay-per-use cloud services

## Sample Architectures for Multi-Subscription Orchestration

### 1. Azure-Native Central Orchestration (Hub-and-Spoke Model)

A central orchestration service in a hub subscription coordinates activities across multiple spoke subscriptions:

#### Using Azure Data Factory + Event Grid
- Deploy Data Factory in hub subscription
- Configure Event Grid in spokes to forward events to hub
- Use Logic Apps to aggregate events when needed
- Trigger ADF pipelines or Durable Functions with cross-subscription access
- Execute using Azure's managed compute resources

#### Using Azure Data Factory (Managed Airflow) as Central Scheduler
- Deploy Managed Airflow environment in hub subscription
- Develop Python DAGs that trigger tasks across subscriptions
- Configure service principals with appropriate permissions in each subscription
- Leverage Airflow UI as central orchestration dashboard

**Security Consideration:** Create managed identities or service principals with specific roles in each subscription.

### 2. Open-Source Orchestrator with Distributed Agents

#### Central Orchestrator Setup
- Deploy main scheduler/server in hub subscription (AKS or VM)
- Install Airflow scheduler, web server, database or Prefect server

#### Agents/Workers in Each Subscription
- Deploy worker processes in each subscription
- Use Celery Executors (Airflow) or Prefect agents in each subscription
- Configure network connectivity between components

#### Task Routing
- Direct tasks to specific workers/agents based on subscription needs
- Tag tasks with appropriate queue/pool identifiers

#### Example Workflow
- Task A runs on agent in Subscription X
- Task B runs on agent in Subscription Y
- Task C aggregates results centrally

### 3. Decentralized Event-Driven Orchestration (Choreography)

An alternative approach using event-driven architecture:

- Applications emit events upon completion (via Service Bus or Event Grid)
- Subscribers listen for multiple prerequisite events before starting their work
- Use Azure Event Grid with custom topics to aggregate events
- Implement small Durable Functions with wait-for-all pattern

**Pros:** Decoupled, no single point of failure, naturally cloud-native
**Cons:** More complex to design and debug, less centralized control

### 4. Hybrid Approach

Combine multiple tools for different scenarios:

- **Airflow/Prefect** for complex multi-step pipelines
- **Logic Apps/Durable Functions** for simpler or event-driven workflows
- **Event Grid** for connecting components and triggering actions

## Migration Strategy and Considerations

### 1. Discovery and Assessment
- **Inventory All Jobs**: Extract AutoSys job definitions and document properties
- **Dependency Mapping**: Create workflow graphs showing job relationships
- **Resource Usage and Criticality**: Note SLAs, resource needs, and priorities
- **Categorize by Type**: Group jobs into functional categories

### 2. Plan the Target for Each Category
- Assign appropriate orchestration tool for each job category
- Design equivalent workflows in new systems
- Document any behavioral differences or special considerations

### 3. Infrastructure Setup
- Deploy orchestration environment in parallel to AutoSys
- Configure networking, security, and credentials
- Establish CI/CD for orchestration code

### 4. Pilot Migration (Proof of Concept)
- Implement non-critical workflow in new orchestrator
- Run in parallel with AutoSys to compare behavior
- Adjust configurations based on findings

### 5. Iterate and Migrate Workflows in Batches
- Move workflows incrementally by business area or type
- For each batch:
  - Implement in new tool
  - Test with parallel or dry runs
  - Enable production triggers once validated
  - Monitor closely after cutover
- Maintain communication with stakeholders throughout

### 6. Decommissioning AutoSys
- Keep AutoSys running briefly as fallback
- Archive job definitions for reference
- Shut down scheduler and remove agents after stable period

### 7. Post-Migration Optimization
- Identify workflow improvement opportunities
- Train team to leverage new system capabilities
- Establish updated support procedures and documentation

**Risk Mitigation:** Start with non-critical workflows, validate thoroughly, and monitor costs carefully.
