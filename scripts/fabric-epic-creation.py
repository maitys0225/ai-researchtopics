# 
# Here's a Python script that uses the GitLab API to:
# Create an Epic in a GitLab group.
# Create Issues under that Epic based on acceptance criteria.
# Assign milestones for tracking.
# Add a placeholder for the evaluation report and other deliverables.
# Note: Youâ€™ll need:
# A GitLab personal access token with appropriate permissions.
# The group ID where the Epic will be created.
# The project ID where issues will be created (you can use one project or split them across several).
#

# How to Use
# Replace YOUR_GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN, YOUR_GROUP_ID, and YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your real values.

# Install requests if you havenâ€™t:

# ```bash
# pip install requests
# ````
# Run the script from your terminal or Python IDE.

import requests

# ==== CONFIGURATION ====
