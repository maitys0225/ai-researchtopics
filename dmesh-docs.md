Below is an extensive plan to organize your Data Mesh documentation. The plan is structured to cover foundational concepts, architecture, implementation strategies, operations, governance, and more. This framework can be adapted based on your organization's needs, maturity level, and audience (technical, managerial, or cross-functional). Each major section is broken down into topics and subtopics for clarity.
